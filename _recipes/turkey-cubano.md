name: Turkey Cubano
description: Traditionalists would shoot me for the modifications I've made 
    to the sandwich, but it still packs a lot of flavor.  The quantity of 
    ingredients is up to individual diner.  I typically lay on 4 slices of 
    turkey, 2 of cheese, and enough pickles and mustard to stretch the length of
    the sandwich.
servings: Serves 1
ingredients:
    - Oven roasted turkey slices
    - Gruyere, Emmenthaler, or other swiss cheese, sliced
    - Yellow mustard
    - Bread and butter pickle chips or sweet relish
    - White or ciabatta sandwich rolls (or Cuban bread if you can nab it, of course)
instructions:
    - Preheat oven to 450
    - Spray a cookie sheet with PAM or grease with olive oil
    - Compile the sandwich per the recommendation above.  A nice balance is 4 slices of turkey, 
        2 slices of cheese, mustard on one side of the roll, and relish or pickle chips stacked on the mustard
    - Place the sandwich on the cookie sheet.  Place a heavy, oven proof object (like a cast iron skillet) on the sandwich
    - Spray or oil the top of the sandwich
    - Bake for 10-12 minutes until the sandwich is warm, the cheese is melted, and the bread has formed a nice browned crust
