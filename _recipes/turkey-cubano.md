# Turkey Cubano

Traditionalists would shoot me for the modifications I've made to the sandwich, 
but it still packs a lot of flavor.  The quantity of ingredients is up to 
individual diner.  I typically lay on 4 slices of turkey, 2 of cheese, and 
enough pickles and mustard to stretch the length of the sandwich.

Instructions 

1. Preheat oven to 450
2. Spray a cookie sheet with PAM or grease with olive oil
3. Compile the sandwich per the recommendation above.  A nice balance is 4 slices of turkey, 2 slices of cheese,
mustard on one side of the roll, and relish or pickle chips stacked on the mustard
4. Place the sandwich on the cookie sheet.  Place a heavy, oven proof object (like a cast iron skillet) on the sandwich
5. Spray or oil the top of the sandwich
6. Bake for 10-12 minutes until the sandwich is warm, the cheese is melted, and the bread has formed a nice browned crust
