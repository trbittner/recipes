description: This can be adjusted to your personal preference for doneness, but
    it takes a lot of the variability out of the cooking process that's plagued
    me for years.

    - 2 8-12 oz. steaks (preferably 1 - 1/2 in. thick)
    - Steak seasoning (if you use marinade, follow those directions prior to cooking)

    - Remove steak from refrigerator and allow to rest 20 minutes while preheating.
    - Preheat oven to 400
    - Place the steak on a wire wrack or broiler pan
    - Cook the steaks 10 minutes a side
    - Remove steaks from oven and turn on broiler
    - Broil the steaks 2 minutes a side (for medium-rare to medium) one inch
