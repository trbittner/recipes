description: This is more a template that can be scaled down for a side or altered for other variations.
    I don't boil water as most recipes typically prescribe.  Instead, I place the pasta in a pot, cover 
    it with just enough water, add salt, and then heat.  This requires the time to bring the water to 
    temperature and boil at the lower recommendation of al dente.  I haven't noticed a sacrifice in 
    taste to doing this and it saves on water and (a bit) of time.
